## Hey,

I'm Josiah, mainly a back end developer that dabbles into front end development from time to time.

Discovered my love for code when i had written my first print("Hello World") In python and since then have been hooked since, taking classes in middle school and high school and now in college. Throught coding i also found out i have a strong connection with networking such as UDP / TCP IP, IPV4 and IPV6. I've even created a C++ Networking engine that uses those key components.

My main programming langugages are

- Python
- Javascript
- Java
- SQL
- C ++

For certifications, i have,

- CompTia A+
- CompTia Network+
